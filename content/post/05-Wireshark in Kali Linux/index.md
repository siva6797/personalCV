## **Unveiling the Power of Metasploit Framework in Kali Linux: A Complete Guide to Ethical Hacking**

### Introduction:
Wireshark, the world's foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer, serves as a pivotal tool for network analysis, troubleshooting, and security assessments. Integrated into Kali Linux, a popular Linux distribution for penetration testing and ethical hacking, Wireshark empowers cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts alike to scrutinize network traffic, identify vulnerabilities, and fortify defenses against potential threats.

> ### How to download Wireshark
Downloading and installing Wireshark is easy. Step one is to check the official [Wireshark download page](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) for the operating system you need. The installation is simple, and the basic version of Wireshark is free.

### Installation of Wireshark in Wireshark for Windows

Wireshark comes in two options for Windows: 32-bit and 64-bit. Pick the correct version for your OS; the current release is 3.0.3 as of this writing.

### Installation of Wireshark in Wireshark for Mac

Wireshark is available on Mac as a Homebrew install.

To install Homebrew, you need to run this command at your Terminal prompt:

#### /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)” 

Once you have the Homebrew system in place, you can access several open-source projects for your Mac. To install Wireshark, run this command from the Terminal:

```bash
brew install wireshark
```
Homebrew will download and install Wireshark and any dependencies needed to function correctly.

Wireshark for Linux
Installing Wireshark on Linux can be a little different depending on the Linux distribution. If you aren’t running one of the following distros, please double-check the commands.

### Installation of Wireshark in Ubuntu

From a Terminal prompt, run these commands:
```bash
sudo apt-get install wireshark
sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
sudo adduser $USER wireshark
```
Those commands download and update the package, and add user privileges to run Wireshark.

### Installation of Wireshark in Red Hat Fedora

From a Terminal prompt, run these commands:

sudo dnf install wireshark-qt
sudo usermod -a -G wireshark username
The first command installs the GUI and CLI version of Wireshark, and the second adds permissions to use Wireshark.

### Installation of Wireshark in Kali Linux:
Installing Wireshark on Kali Linux is a straightforward process. Open a terminal and execute the following commands:
{style="text-align: justify;"}

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wireshark
```
During the installation process, you may be prompted to grant Wireshark the necessary permissions to capture packets. It is essential to allow this access for Wireshark to function effectively.

### When should Wireshark be used?
Wireshark can be used to understand how communication takes place across a network and to analyze what went wrong when an issue in communication arises.

**Wireshark helps:**

- Network administrators troubleshoot problems across a network
- Security engineers examine security issues across a network
- QA engineers verify applications
- Developers debug protocol implementations
- Network users learn about a specific protocol


### When shouldn’t Wireshark be used?
Wireshark can help troubleshoot many network issues, and it can be used as an educational tool. However, 

**Wireshark cannot:**

- **Help a user who doesn’t understand network protocols:** Users must first know how a network operates in order to use Wireshark.
- **Grab traffic from locations other than your local computer and the system it talks to:** Wireshark cannot grab traffic from all of the other systems on a network.
- **Notify you of alerts:** The closest Wireshark can do is apply color-coding and show malformed packets.

### Understanding Wireshark Interface:
Upon launching Wireshark, users are presented with a user-friendly interface showcasing various menus, toolbars, and packet display panes. Key components include:

- **Capture Options:** Enables users to select the network interface for packet capture and configure capture filters.
- **Packet List Pane:** Displays captured packets in a tabular format, showcasing details such as source and destination addresses, protocol, and packet length.
- **Packet Details Pane:** Provides a comprehensive breakdown of selected packets, including protocol-specific information.
Filtering Options: Facilitates the application of display filters to focus on specific packets or protocols.

### Wireshark command line
Wireshark does provide a [command line interface (CLI)](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChCustCommandLine.html) if you operate a system without a graphical user interface (GUI). The best practice would be to use the CLI to capture and save a log so you can review the log with the GUI.

###  Wireshark commands
- **wireshark :** run Wireshark in GUI mode
- **wireshark –h :** show available command line parameters for Wireshark
- **wireshark –a duration:300 –i eth1 –w wireshark. :** capture traffic on the ethernet interface one for five minutes. –a means automatically stop the capture, -i specifies which interface to capture

### Types of Attacks and How to Execute Them
> **1. Packet Sniffing:**

Packet sniffing involves intercepting and inspecting network traffic to gather sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data. Wireshark facilitates packet sniffing by capturing packets traversing the network.

**Example Command:**
Launch Wireshark and select the appropriate network interface for packet capture. Apply filters if necessary to focus on specific traffic.

**Outcome:**
Upon capturing packets, Wireshark displays detailed information, including plaintext credentials, HTTP requests, and other potentially sensitive data transmitted over the network.

> **2. ARP Spoofing:**

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing enables attackers to intercept network traffic by impersonating legitimate network devices. Wireshark aids in detecting ARP spoofing attacks by monitoring ARP traffic and identifying inconsistencies.

Example Command:
Utilize tools such as arpspoof to perform ARP spoofing attacks while simultaneously monitoring network traffic with Wireshark.

Outcome:
Wireshark reveals anomalous ARP traffic, including spoofed ARP replies and conflicts between MAC and IP addresses, indicating the presence of ARP spoofing.

> **3. DNS Spoofing:**


DNS spoofing involves manipulating DNS responses to redirect users to malicious websites or counterfeit domains. Wireshark assists in detecting DNS spoofing attacks by analyzing DNS traffic and identifying irregularities in DNS responses.

**Example Command:**
Employ DNS spoofing tools like dnsspoof to forge DNS responses and redirect traffic to a controlled server. Concurrently, monitor DNS traffic using Wireshark to identify discrepancies.

**Outcome:**
Wireshark captures DNS traffic and highlights forged DNS responses, enabling security practitioners to identify and mitigate DNS spoofing attacks promptly.


### Ethical Considerations:
While Wireshark serves as a potent tool for network analysis and security assessments, it is imperative to exercise caution and adhere to ethical guidelines. Conducting network attacks or intercepting sensitive information without proper authorization constitutes unethical and potentially illegal behavior. Moreover, deploying Wireshark in production environments without consent may violate privacy regulations and compromise the integrity of network operations.

Security professionals and ethical hackers must prioritize transparency, integrity, and respect for privacy when utilizing Wireshark or any other network analysis tool. Obtaining explicit authorization from relevant stakeholders before conducting security assessments or penetration tests is essential to ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

In conclusion, Wireshark stands as a versatile and indispensable tool for network analysis, offering comprehensive capabilities for packet capture, protocol analysis, and vulnerability detection. By leveraging Wireshark effectively and responsibly, cybersecurity professionals can enhance network security, mitigate risks, and safeguard against potential threats.
