title: Explore on Securing Development and operations (Web Application Security)
summary: 'Enterprises aiming for rapid Internet-based service deployment emphasize Continuous Delivery, ensuring swift and safe integration of changes. In the web application development process, security threats necessitate preemptive measures, including penetration tests, to uphold throughput, stability, and overall application performance.'

To stay ahead of the competition, enterprises need to be able to turn an Internet-based business idea into a fully functioning service in double-quick time. Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all types—including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments—into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way.
In the process of web application development, organizations face some security threats by the hackers. It adversely affects the business and reputation. An application performance is measured by the throughput and stability. Throughput is measured by deployment frequency and lead time for change. Stability is measured by mean time to recover and the ability to preemptively detect and mitigate problems.
To ensure this throughput and stability, we need to enforce more security policies to the application. So penetration tests have to be done prior to release along with other generic tests.
