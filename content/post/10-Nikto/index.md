### Download and Installation 

Nikto is readily available in Kali Linux, a popular Linux distribution for penetration testing and ethical hacking. 

**Install (recommended):** Run from a git [repo](https://github.com/sullo/nikto)

**Download** [Latest GitHub Release (zip)](https://github.com/sullo/nikto/archive/master.zip)

Here's how to install Nikto on Kali Linux:

1) **Update Kali Linux:** Before installing Nikto, it's recommended to update your Kali Linux system to ensure you have the latest packages and dependencies.

```shell
sudo apt update
```

2) **Install Nikto:** Use the following command to install Nikto:
```shell
sudo apt install nikto
```

Once installed, you're ready to start using Nikto to scan web servers for vulnerabilities.


### Usage

Using Nikto is straightforward, and it offers a variety of options to customize your scans. Here's a basic command to get you started:

```php
nikto -h <target>
```

Replace '**target**' with the URL or IP address of the web server you want to scan. Nikto will then begin its comprehensive assessment, providing a detailed report of any vulnerabilities or potential security risks it discovers.


### Sample Examples

Let's explore a few sample examples of using Nikto:

1) **Basic Scan:**
```code
nikto -h example.com
```

2) **Scan with Output to File:**
```code
nikto -h example.com -o report.html
```

3) **Scan Multiple Targets:**
```code
nikto -h example1.com example2.com example3.com
```

### Use Cases

Nikto finds its utility in various scenarios, including:

- **Penetration Testing:** Identifying vulnerabilities in web servers and web applications during penetration tests.

- **Security Auditing:** Conducting routine security audits to ensure web servers are secure against known threats.

- **System Administration:** Assessing the security posture of web servers and addressing vulnerabilities to enhance overall security.


### Ethical Considerations:

While Nikto is a powerful tool for identifying security weaknesses, it's essential to use it responsibly and ethically. Here are a few considerations:

- **Obtain Proper Authorization:** Only scan web servers that you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning can be illegal and unethical.

- **Respect Privacy:** Avoid collecting unnecessary information during scans, and handle any sensitive data discovered with care and confidentiality.

- **Report Vulnerabilities Responsibly:** If you discover vulnerabilities, report them to the appropriate parties responsibly, following established disclosure guidelines.


### Conclusion:

Nikto stands as a valuable asset in the toolkit of cybersecurity professionals, offering a comprehensive solution for identifying vulnerabilities in web servers and web applications. By understanding its features, installation process, usage, sample examples, use cases, and ethical considerations, you can harness its power effectively while upholding ethical standards in your security practices. Stay vigilant, stay secure!
