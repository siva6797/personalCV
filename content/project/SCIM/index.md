The **System for Cross-domain Identity Management** (SCIM) specification is designed to make managing user identities in **cloud-based applications** and **services easier**. 

The specification suite seeks to build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models. 

Its intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing a common user schema and extension model, as well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema using standard protocols. In essence: make it fast, cheap, and easy to move users into, out of, and around the cloud.
