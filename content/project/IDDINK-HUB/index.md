IDDINKHUB is the bride between the two counter parties where schools want to get the student and teacher information from the education software like Magister and EduArte

In this project we implemented the UWLR standared protocol to exchange the information 

counter parties as follow in details
1. **Educational Applications(EA)**

An EA is a system, possibly alongside other educational activities, may decrease in student and keys, and this determines a test result. An EA can be present within the school or operated by a third party (usually a publisher).

2. **Student Administration System (LAS)**

A LAS administers the data of a student and within a school. This concerns the data of the student (NAW) and his learning outcomes. A LAS does not take any tests itself.
